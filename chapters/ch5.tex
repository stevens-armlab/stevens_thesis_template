One of the advantages of LaTex is the ease of organizing citations. To cite a book or paper, for example, Shannon's mutual information theory \cite{shannon1949mathematical}, you need to 
\begin{itemize}
	\item find the BibTex code can be found from Google Scholar (or software like Mendeley)
	\item copy an paste the BibTex code into the ``refs.bib'' file
\end{itemize}
